spring-rest-template
====================
 
Spring Rest Template is a template for building JSON based RESTful services(to a degree). It contains Hibernate, Spring MVC, Spring Security, Jackson JSON parser integrated... Just ready to go. Maven is used for building and dependency management.

Hopefully no more "1h development 46543573h configuration" problems for early phases in projects.
